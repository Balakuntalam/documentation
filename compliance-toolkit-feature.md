# COMPLIANCE TOOL KIT

MOSIP’s compliance tool kit is a testing kit which can be used by MOSIP partners to check the compliance of the integration of their components with MOSIP. As a part of the compliance tool kit, the verification of compliance is allowed for the following:

* SBI (Secure Biometric Interface) for L1 or L0 devices: 
MOSIP’s device partners are required to build a software layer for their devices to communicate with MOSIP’s registration client or authentication client securely as per the specifications defined by MOSIP as part of the SBI Specs. The compliance tool kit should make sure that the interface built by the device provider is following the specs, and security and integrity rules defined in the SBI spec.

* SDK for biometrics: 
MOSIP’s Biometric Service providers are also required to build an interface between their solution and MOSIP to smoothen the communication between the two entities. The compliance tool kit would make sure that these interfaces are as per the MOSIP defined specifications for smooth interaction.
