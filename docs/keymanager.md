# Key Manager

## Overview 
The Key Manager Service provides secure storage, provisioning and management of secret data. It provides all the cryptographic operations like encryption/decryption & digital signature/verification making one trust store for all partner trust path validation. It manages the lifecycle of encryption/decryption keys, including generation, distribution, administration, and deletion.

This includes keying material such as symmetric keys, asymmetric keys, certificates and algorithm data.  It is a web-based key management solution that helps consolidate, control, manage, monitor, all key generation and maintenance of key life cycle required in MOSIP. 

Key Manager interfaces with key store like [Hardware Security Module (HSM)](hsm.md) and Database (`mosip_keymgr` DB).

Refer [Keys](keys.md) for all references of the type 'Kx' and 'KPx'.

In MOSIP, cryptographic keys can be generated using two options:
1. Using Key-generator job or
2. Using **Key Manager** option in [Admin portal](admin-portal-user-guide.md#Key-Manager)

After the deployment, the initial set of pre-requisite keys has to be generated by the Administrator to complete the Key Manager setup. This generation is a one-time activity, and afterwards, the Key Manager will auto-generate all the required Root key and Module master keys upon expiry of key duration. All the encryption keys will be auto- generated and the administrator is not required to request for generation. All the encryption keys will be auto-generated upon expiry of the key duration. 

## Encryption algorithms
* RSA-2048 for all data encryption
* AES-256 for [zero-knowledge encryption](data-protection.md#zero-knowledge-encryption)

## Key hierarchy

|Key|Location|Issuer|Purpose|Example|
|---|---|---|---|
|Root|[HSM](hsm.md)|Self signed|Root|[K1](keys.md)|
|Module|[HSM](hsm.md)|Root||Signing, encryption of Base keys|[K7](keys.md)|
|Base|Database|Module|K7.5|Encryption of registration packet etc.|[K7.5](keys.md)|

Root and Module keys reside in HSM while Base key pair reside in the DB encrypted by Module keys. All references (aliases) containing metadata of keys are present in [`key_alias`](db_scripts/mosip_keymgr/ddl/keymgr-key_alias.sql) table of `mosip_keymgr` DB. The [`key_store`](db_scripts/mosip_keymgr/ddl/keymgr-key_store.sql) tables contains encrypted Base keys. 

The keys are identified as tuple of `app_id` and `ref_id`.
* `app_id`: Typically, module name e.g. `REGISTRATION`.  
* `ref_id`: Specified only for Base keys (except SIGN\*). Eg. `10001_110011`   

\* `SIGN`: _TBD_

## Key generation process 
Key Manager helps you generate new key pairs and deploy them to endpoint servers. There are two ways to generate fresh key pairs from Key Manager:
*	Key-generator job, and
*	Rest API call

The job generates option under ``` key-generator job ``` allows you to generate all the configured ```APP_IDs``` master keys in [HSM](hsm.md). It associate only module keys.

Alternatively, you can also generate key using Rest API call ```/keymanager/generateMasterKey``` and simultaneously deploy them to various user accounts. This can be done with help of ```KEY_MAKER``` wherein it is not required generating key with generator job.

## Generate encryption keys 
Key Manager stores the path of the encryption key in a configuration file with an unique UUID. Therefore, Encryption keys are automatically generated if itâ€™s not available in Database. 

Once the API repository that allows call on ```getCertificate/generateCSR``` API will automatically generates the key if not available in Database and returns the certificate/CSR.

## Perform and track key management operations 
Once keys are associated with their user, you can perform a range of key management operations like crypto that allows:
* Digital signing of data using Module key
* Data encryption using Encryption key

The different keys in MOSIP have their own built-in validity as mentioned:
*	MOSIP root key- 5 years
*	Module key- 3 years
*	Encryption key (base key)- 2 years

You can edit key validity before key generation by updating the required values in ```key_policy_def``` table.

### Key revoke/rotate
You can configure existing key to revoke MOSIP root key or module key invoke ```/keymanager/generateMasterKey``` API with **force** attribute as **true**. API invalidates existing key and immediately generates new key.
 
Whereas, you can configure existing key to revoke encryption/base key invoke ```/keymanager/revokeKey``` Rest API with the respective ```APP_ID``` and ```REF_ID```.

## Encryption/decryption process
We strongly recommend that you store the encryption key outside Key Manager server - preferably in any other separate machine or in any external drive (hard drive, thumb drive etc.,). And in such cases, you have to make sure that Key Manager server has full permission to access the device and the encryption key stored in it, whenever you start Key Manager service.

### Encryption process 
*	Random AES 256-bit key will be generated, generated random key will be used to encrypt the actual registration packet.
*	Random generated key will be encrypted using the certificate received from server. Certificate contains RSA 2048 bit key.
*	Certificate Thumbprint will be computed.
*	Thumbprint will be prepend to encrypted random key for key identification.
*	Finally, the encrypted random key with prepended thumbprint will be concated with encrypted registration packet using #KEY_SPLITTER# as separator.

### Decryption process 
*	Registration packet data will be split to get the encrypted random key, encrypted registration data, certificate thumbprint.
*	Identifies the respective private key to decryption process.
*	Identified private key will be decrypted with the mapped master key.
*	Decrypted private key will be used to decrypt the encrypted random key.
*	Decrypt the registration packet using the decrypted random key.
*	Returns the decrypted data to REG_PROC.

## Encryption in Registration Client 
*	Registration Client sends request to sync data service for the client configuration data.
*	Sync Data service requests Key Manager service to provide the reg-client specific certificate. Key identifier will be APP_ID - REGISTRATION, REF_ID - CENTER-ID_MACHINE-ID.
*	Key Manager service generate a new key pair, encrypts the private key with REGISTRATION master key and creates a new certificate using same master. 
*	Returns the certificate to Sync data service. If key pair is already available and is valid, returns the available certificate.
*	Sync data service sends the certificate to Registration Client.
*	The registration packet will be encrypted using the certificate received from the server after collecting all the required data for registration, including adding the digital signatures required to the registration data, and before saving/writing the data on the Registration Client hard-disk.
*	REG_PROC sends request to decrypt the data to Key Manager service with same app_id and ref_id.
