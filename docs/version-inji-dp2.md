**Upgrade From**: Inji 0.10.0 

**Support**: Developer Preview Release2

**Release Date**: 22nd January, 2024

## Overview

The Developer Preview Version2 release is an additional release on top of Inji 0.10.0. This release primarily emphasizes:

* UI enhancements
* Internal enhancements
* Security fixes
* Bug fixes

## Summary

Below is the detailed summary of the release.

### UI enhancements

* As a part of the VC sharing feature or listing of VCs for QR login, the Pinned VC will now appear on top of the VC list.
* User can now provide one time consent for a selected VC  while sharing the claims during QR code login.
* Additionally, a search bar has been added to the `Add new card` screen to improve user experience by allowing users to search for issuers based on the title. 
* Furthermore, any rendering issues in the user interface have been resolved.

### Internal enhancements

Secure KeyStore and Tuvali have been integrated with INJI as NPM dependencies. For further information, please refer to the provided documentation.
Additionally, all image assets have been converted to svg format from png. This change allows for a more efficient usage of assets, and the icons' colors will now be dynamically rendered based on the app theme.

* Branding the App as `Inji`:
  * We've rebranded the application, transitioning from `Resident App` to the more streamlined and recognisable `Inji`.
* Ability to Choose Language During App Setup:
  * Inji app users can configure the application in six distinct languages:
    * English
    * Filipino
    * Arabic
    * Hindi
    * Kannada
    * Tamil
* Warning When Device Storage is Beyond the Threshold:
  * Inji now offers customisable storage limits:
    * For VC downloads, the threshold is set to 5MB. When the device's remaining storage space falls below this limit, Inji displays a warning message. However, users can still continue to verify and share VCs.
    * For Inji audit logs, the threshold is set to 1MB. Once the device reaches this limit, Inji users will be restricted to viewing VCs, unable to perform additional actions.
* Traceability with Unique ID for Customer Support:
  * We've implemented a unique identification called as an Application ID for customer support interactions. Each support request is now assigned a traceable and distinct ID, allowing our support teams to efficiently track, manage, and resolve customer issues.

### Internal improvements

* Improved Bluetooth State and Permission Handling:
  * We have refined the management of Bluetooth states and permissions.
* Removed `Google Nearby` Implementation:
  * We've transitioned to using [Tuvali](https://docs.mosip.io/inji/tuvali) for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication, enhancing the connectivity experience.
* Encrypted VCâ€™s Metadata:
  * We now calculate and securely store an encrypted HASH (HMAC SHA256) of the VC's metadata key in the database, bolstering data security.
