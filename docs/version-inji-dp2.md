* Bug fixes

## Summary

Below is the detailed summary of the release.

### UI enhancements

* As a part of the VC sharing feature or listing of VCs for QR login, the Pinned VC will now appear on top of the VC list.
* User can now provide one time consent for a selected VC  while sharing the claims during QR code login.
* Additionally, a search bar has been added to the `Add new card` screen to improve user experience by allowing users to search for issuers based on the title. 
* Furthermore, any rendering issues in the user interface have been resolved.

### Internal enhancements

* Secure KeyStore and Tuvali have been integrated as independent NPM modules within the INJI framework. For further information, please refer to the provided documentation.
* Additionally, all image assets have been converted from png to svg format. This transition ensures the presence of a single asset set, and the color of the icons will now be dynamically rendered based on the application's theme.
  
### Internal improvements

* Improved Bluetooth State and Permission Handling:
  * We have refined the management of Bluetooth states and permissions.
* Removed `Google Nearby` Implementation:
  * We've transitioned to using [Tuvali](https://docs.mosip.io/inji/tuvali) for Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication, enhancing the connectivity experience.
* Encrypted VCâ€™s Metadata:
  * We now calculate and securely store an encrypted HASH (HMAC SHA256) of the VC's metadata key in the database, bolstering data security.
