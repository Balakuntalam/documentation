# Server Hardware Requirements

## Overview
MOSIP deployment is split into two distinct parts:
1. [ID lifecycle managament](id-lifecycle-management.md)
   * Pre-registration
   * Registration
2. [ID Authentication](id-authentication.md)

We provide server side hardware estimates for [MOSIP core modules](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-infra/tree/1.2.0-rc2/deployment/v3/mosip) only. Estimates for [external components](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-infra/tree/1.2.0-rc2/deployment/v3/external) are not in the scope.  The requirements are specified at a high level in terms  of Virtual CPU (VPU), RAM and storage.

The variables that largely determine the hardware requirements are:
1. Population of a country
1. Rate of enrollment
1. Usage of foundation ID by various services

## Pre-registration

## Registration (enrollment)



## ID Authentication
