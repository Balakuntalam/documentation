### Step-by-Step Process

**Step 1: Access the Partner Management Portal:**

Visit the following URL to access the Partner Management portal in the Collab environment: [Partner Management Portal](https://iam.collab.mosip.net/auth/realms/mosip/protocol/openid-connect/auth?client_id=mosip-pms-client&redirect_uri=https://api.collab.mosip.net/v1/partnermanager/login-redirect/aHR0cHM6Ly9wbXAuY29sbGFiLm1vc2lwLm5ldC8=&state=b3feca86-1305-4bec-a861-c074af4bea6a&response_type=code&scope=email).

* Get your credentials by simply registering yourself by clicking on `New user` on [PMP](https://iam.collab.mosip.net/auth/realms/mosip/protocol/openid-connect/auth?client_id=mosip-pms-client&redirect_uri=https://api.collab.mosip.net/v1/partnermanager/login-redirect/aHR0cHM6Ly9wbXAuY29sbGFiLm1vc2lwLm5ldC8=&state=b3feca86-1305-4bec-a861-c074af4bea6a&response_type=code&scope=email#).

**Step 3: Explore the features on the Partner Management Portal**

To access all the features of the Partner Management portal and explore the partner onboarding process in MOSIP, refer to our [end user guide](https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/modules/partner-management-services/partner-management-portal).

> **Note**: We kindly request you to fill out the attached form in order to request a password modification for your account. This is necessary as the current Partner Management Portal (PMP) in the Collab environment does not allow users to change their passwords independently.

Our team will promptly assist you with your password customization.
