# Pre-Registration Captcha

Captcha protects your website from fraud and abuse. It uses an advanced risk analysis engine and adaptive challenges to keep malicious software.

* Get Captcha for the sandbox domain from "Google Re-captcha Admin" if you would like to allow Captcha for Pre-Reg UI. Get **reCAPTCHA v2** keys for _**"I'm not a robot"**_
* Set Captcha as:

  ```text
  google.recaptcha.site.key=sitekey
  google.recaptcha.secret.key=secret
  ```
