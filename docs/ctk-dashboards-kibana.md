# CTK Dashboards in Kibana

* Kibana houses ten CTK Dashboards, which aid in presenting data in a comprehensible and significant manner.
  
* These dashboards facilitate continuous monitoring of data and system metrics. Users are able to establish visualizations that automatically update as new data is received.
  
* Kibana needs environmental access. 
  
* Within the dashboard, **search** and **filtering** functionalities can be utilized.
  
* It should be noted that the data stored in Kibana may not be completely secure. To mitigate risks, we have taken precautions such as excluding sensitive data columns and allowing only necessary information for dashboard visualization.
