# Sandbox Details

Are you a relying party looking to integrate with the e-Signet? Feel free to signup here. This will allow you access to our sandbox to test and integrate.

TODO: details of the collab and synergy. Also, point out the difference. collab is for the nightly build sandbox and synergy is for the released version.

## Collab
Collab is our development integration environment which can be used by our partners to build on top of or integrate with the QA certified version of the platform during an ongoing release.

QA tested sprint deliverables of a current release are deployed in this environment.

Environment links are available at [here](https://collab.mosip.net/)

## Synergy

Synergy is our environment where the latest released version of the platform (currently, v1.2.0.1) is deployed for partners to integrate and test their solutions.


Small video of how to register yourself.

As of now, we do not have the UI so can we provide the postman scripts or expose the swagger here?
