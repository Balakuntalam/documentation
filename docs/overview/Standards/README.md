### eSignet relies on standards

eSignet implements [**OpenID Connect**](https://openid.net/connect/) and [**OAuth 2.0**](https://oauth.net/2/) flows to work its magic. We have chosen the most secure and trustworthy flow to ensure user privacy and data security.

eSignet relies on [**SBI (Secure Biometric Interface)**](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/3167/10925/) to enable an ecosystem of biometric players. To have a look at the supported devices, click [here](https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/biometrics/biometric-devices).

eSignet leverages emerging standards for using verifiable credentials with OpenID and for wallet integration.

To learn more about the open standards followed by eSignet, read:

* [OAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/)
* [OpenID Connect](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1\_0.html)
* [OpenID4VCI](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-credential-issuance-1\_0.html)
* [IEEE SA P3167 SBI 2.0](https://standards.ieee.org/ieee/3167/10925/)

As eSignet utilizes **OpenID Connect**, a wide range of client libraries are available for seamless integration. Therefore, it is recommended to avoid creating custom code for the integration process.
