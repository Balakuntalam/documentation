## Objectives

Let us understand the key objectives of eSignet:

### User Centricity

At eSignet, our core goals are to prioritize inclusion and accessibility. We place a strong emphasis on user privacy and data protection. Our platform, eSignet, aims to simplify users' lives by offering flexibility and choices when it comes to identity verification.

* **One ID**: Gain access to multiple services with ease. Users can log in to integrated government and private sector services using a single identity credential.

* **Mandatory User Consent**: Before allowing access to personal information, we require users to provide explicit consent. Our platform incorporates a built-in consent flow.

* **Multiple modes of authentication**: We offer various methods for identity verification to accommodate individual preferences.

* **Credential protection**: We ensure that login credentials are not shared with relying parties. The login process takes place exclusively on the eSignet platform.

### Go digital quickly

* Fast and secure digital verification across services.

* Ability to verify residents with the same level of assurance as during registration (OTP, Biometric, Cryptographic key).

* Empower the government to offer digital verification and e-KYC as a service, enabling improved access to financial inclusion.

* Easy integration with relying parties, as we follow standard-based protocols, reducing time to market.

* Narrow and bridge the digital divide by enabling multiple modes of verification.
