# Contribution

e-Signet is a product of the combined efforts of multiple stakeholders. Contributions from the community form the backbone and drive its growth and stability. The contributions have come in multiple ways, ranging from direct code contributions, review of design and architecture, bug fixing, and support for technology evaluation.
