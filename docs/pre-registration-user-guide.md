# Overview
This guide helps in understanding the pre-registration sample UI implementation.

## Pre-registration process
The key steps in this module are:
* Login/create a user account
* Create an Application
* Book an Appointment
* Receive a Confirmation

Below is the description of the options available in the sample UI Implementation

## Login/create a user account

### Preferred Language selection
The Pre-registration module in MOSIP supports multiple languages. On the login page, MOSIP provides the user an option to select the language of preference for accessing the pre-registration portal.  
The dropdown present on the Login page will display the list of languages. Once the language is selected by the user, the Field and button labels, error and information messages throughout the application will be displayed in the preferred language. 

### Login using email or phone number
Residents can log in to the portal by providing their email address or mobile number. The system validates the email ID or phone number entered, sends an OTP which the resident needs to enter. Once the OTP is validated, the user needs to fill the necessary details for booking an appointment. 

### CAPTCHA support
This is a configurable option provided to the ID issuer. Before requesting for an OTP, the system asks the resident to provide a CAPTCHA. CAPTCHA is used to mitigate DDoS attacks. Once the challenge provided in the CAPTCHA is solved by the resident, the request for an OTP is sent. 

### Logout/session timeout
If the resident wishes to log out of the pre-registration system, they can do so by clicking on the Logout option. The token issued during the authentication of user login is deleted and the user gets logged out of the system. If the user is inactive for say X minutes (X is configurable), the system notifies the user a minute before the configured timeout limit and logs out after a minute. In such a case, no user data is saved.

#### To login/ create a user account
1. Open the browser and visit the pre-registration portal.
2. Select the preferred language.
3. Enter your email address or phone number.
4. Click **Send OTP**.
The user receives an OTP on the registered email ID or the phone number.
5. Enter the OTP and click **Verify**.
Once the OTP is verified, you will see a pop up for selecting the languages for data entry.
6. Select the languages and click **Submit**.

## Create an Application
This section includes some of the key steps for creating an application.

### Language selection for Data capture
* After successful login, based on the language configurations set by the ID issuer, the residents will have the option to select their language of preference to fill up the application details.  
* A user logging in for the first time and having no applications will be prompted with a data capture language pop-up.
* The same set of languages will be used for the next set of applications created in the same session. 
* The language selected by the user in the login screen will be pre-selected in the data capture language pop-up.
**Note**: The user can change this by clicking on the **CHANGE DATA CAPTURE LANGUAGES** button.
          This choice will be available only if the ID issuer has configured usage of optional languages.
      
### Provide consent
Before filling the application form, the user is advised to provide their consent for storage and utilization of their personally identifiable information (PII). The consent is sought from the user for every new application created in the system. On providing their consent, the system redirects the user to start the pre-registration application (demographic details). The data as part of the consent form is rendered as setup by the administrator.

There may be a situation where the user opts to close the Consent Pop-up. In this case, the following scenarios may arise:
1. For a First- time login user:  On clicking **Cancel**, the system will redirect the user to the Dashboard page which means that the user will not be allowed to fill up the details for further processing.
2. For existing users: The existing users could choose to create more applications for their family or acquaintances. This can be possible from two places on the portal:
    a. Click **Create New Application** on the Dashboard: On cancelling the consent pop up while creating a new application, the user would be redirected to the Dashboard page.
    b. Click **Add an Applicant** from **Preview** page: On cancelling the consent pop up while creating a new application, the user would be redirected to the Preview page.

**Note**: Consent is sought from the user for every new application created in the system. The contents of the consent will be displayed in all data capture languages selected.

### Provide Demographic data

The demographic data that needs to be collected from the residents is configurable as per a countryâ€™s requirement. The user is provided with a demographic form based on the ID Object Definition & UI Specification for new pre-registration application. The residents are expected to fills demographic details (e.g., Full Name, Age/DOB, Gender, Residential status, Address, mobile number, email id, etc.). The system validates the fields entered, the system also checks for the mandatory fields. Additionally, the system validates for any blocklisted words entered as configured by the country. Once validated a pre-registration request ID (PRID) is generated and the demographic details provided by the residents gets mapped to that PRID.
On the Demographic Details page, the residents will be able to enter their data in their preferred language.   
A sample image is shown below.

### Upload Documents
MOSIP also empowers the countries with an option to configure the documents which needs to be uploaded by the residents for the registration process.

#### Attaching documents to the application
**Document Categories and Applicable Document Types** 
* When user provides their demographic data, the pre-registration system captures the data. 
* Based on the parameters (from the configuration) for example - gender, age and residential status (Foreigner, National) from the demographic data, applicant types are determined. The pre-registration system then sends the id to the mapping.
* Based on the Applicant type, the Applicable Document categories are received from the mapping. The pre-registration system then displays only applicable categories.
* The Document Category and type of documents in each category to be uploaded varies based on the applicant type. Pre-registration system displays only those types to the applicant.
* Once the documents are uploaded by applicant the system performs virus scan to check the integrity of the document. Once the virus scan is successful, the document is encrypted and stored in the object store.

**Referring to already uploaded documents**
* The POA (Proof of Address) document could be uploaded or can be referred to an already uploaded POA of an existing applicant
* The user could select a particular applicant document to which he wants to refer to.
* When Pre-registering for a family living at the same address, it is not required to upload the same POA repeatedly, instead, they could refer to the document as uploaded by the first family member thereby saving time and space.

**Preview the Data**
Once the user fills up the demographic details and uploads the required documents, they will be able to preview the data. On the Preview page, the residents can choose to **modify** the demographic details by clicking on the modify button at the top right corner. Similarly, they can modify the uploaded documents, but clicking modify at the bottom right corner.
On this page, the user also has an option to add another applicant by clicking **Add an Applicant**. Further, the user can click **Book Now** to book an appointment.

**Create multiple applications**
Once the demographic details are filled and the documents are uploaded, the user can add more applicants. To do so, they can select Add an Applicant option on the preview page or Create New Application option on the Dashboard. The system associates an unique pre-registration ID to the new application(s) created.

### Viewing My Applications

Once the application is created, there could be multiple statuses depending on the data filled by the user/resident or the actions performed by them. The user can view all the pre-registration applications created by them in the Dashboard. The different statuses with a brief explanation are mentioned below:

The applications are sorted and displayed by the order of creation of application. The first application created appears first, latest created/modified application appears at the end. If the user visits the registration center and consumes the appointment, then the application will be removed from the list. If the appointment date has passed, the status changes to "Expired" and is retained on the dashboard for further rebooking/modification as required.

### Modify application data
The user can modify the pre-registration data by opting to select the **modify** option for a specific application. The system provides the demographic form with pre-filled demo details and allows the user to edit the details as required. The system associates the modified demo details with the pre-registration id for which Modify information is initiated.

### Discard application
The user can discard the pre-registration by clicking on the **Delete** icon for the pre-registration ID for which they wish to discard. The system provides the user with two options: **Discard entire Application** or **Cancel** appointment. If the user chooses to discard the entire application, the system deletes all the data mapped to the pre-registration ID and cancels the appointment (if any).
