# MOSIP Documentation Style Guide

## Overview
This style guide provides guidelines for writing clear and consistent MOSIP-related documentation. This document can be used as a reference if you are new to writing in MOSIP!
It is recommended to follow the guidelines mentioned below.

### File naming conventions
1. Every directory/folder can have a README.md file to convey what is present in it or can have any information that will benefit the user.
2. Filenames to start with lowercase. For longer and meaningful names, start with lowercase and then add hyphens (-) instead of underscores (_).
3. Use dots only for extensions in filenames and not for joining words.
4. File names should be as descriptive and meaningful as possible. It is better to avoid using any special characters (& # * !) in the names.

#### Examples

1. Filenames having dots.
