# Changes in Role Management with respect to Client IDs

### Partner Management Services

In previous versions (1.1.5.x) of our system, we utilized the 'mosip-partner-client' for Partner Management Services (PMS). However, starting from version 1.2.0.1 onwards, we have implemented the use of 'mosip-pms-client' instead. This transition has led to updates in service account roles, client scopes, and client configurations. Please find below the details of the changes made to service account roles and client scopes.
