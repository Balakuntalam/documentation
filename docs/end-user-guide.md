### First launch of the app

* The chosen language will be reflected within the app interface. Subsequently, a four-page tutorial for the Inji will be presented, followed by the option to secure the app.
* &#x20;This can be achieved through either a PIN or utilizing the device's Biometrics (such as fingerprint or facial recognition). Once the setting is done, users will be directed to the app's home page.

## Downloading VC

To download VC, there are three methods:

* Downloading VC using the UIN/ VID feature
* Downloading VC using the Application ID feature
* Download VC via eSignet

**Downloading VC using UIN/ VID/ AID**

* On the home page, you will find a plus "+" symbol. Clicking on this symbol will display a list of issuers from which you can download VCs.&#x20;
* Look for the issuer that offers the option to download via UIN and VID. Clicking on this option will present you with the option to download VC from AID and VID.&#x20;
* Fill in the required information in the text box according to your needs, and then click on the **Generate Card** button.&#x20;
* You will be prompted to enter an OTP on the next page, and once you do so, the download will begin automatically.

**Downloading VC via eSignet**

* On the home page, there will be a plus "+" symbol that displays the list of issuers available to download VCs from.&#x20;
* Select the issuer that states **Download via eSignet**. Once clicked, the browser will open and take you to the eSignet page.&#x20;
* There will be an option to download from OTP, which should be selected. Logging in with biometrics will not be possible. Instead, a text box should be filled with your VID and the captcha should be completed in order to enable the **Get OTP** button.&#x20;
* Once clicked, it will redirect to the OTP page. After entering the correct OTP, it will bring us back to the app, landing on a loading page. Once the download is complete, it will take us back to the home page.
