**Downloading VC via eSignet**

* On the home page, there will be a plus "+" symbol that displays the list of issuers available to download VCs from.&#x20;

* There will be an option to **Login with OTP**, which should be selected.
* A text box should be filled with your VID and the captcha should be completed in order to enable the **Get OTP** button.&#x20;
* Upon activation, the system will redirect to the One-Time Password (OTP) validation page. After successfully inputting the correct OTP, the user will be taken back to the application, landing on the loading screen. Following the completion of the download process, the user will be returned to the home page.
