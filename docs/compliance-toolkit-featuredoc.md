# COMPLIANCE TOOL KIT

Compliance Toolkit (CTK) is an online portal that can be used by MOSIP partners to test their compliance with various biometrics related specifications published by MOSIP. As a part of the compliance tool kit, the verification of compliance is allowed for the following:

* SBI: Secure Biometric Interface (SBI) is used to interface with biometric devices
MOSIP’s device partners are required to build a software layer for their devices to communicate with MOSIP’s registration client or authentication client. The specifications that they should follow are defined as Secure Biometrics Interface (SBI) specs. The compliance tool kit should ensure that the interface built by the device provider is following the specs, security and integrity rules defined in the SBI spec.

* SDK: MOSIP’s Biometric Service providers provide an SDK implementation which supports quality check, 1:N match, extraction, conversion of biometrics. MOSIP defines an IBioAPI as specification for this SDK implementation.MOSIP’s Biometric Service providers are also required to build an interface between their solution and MOSIP to smoothen the communication between the two entities. The compliance tool kit would make sure that these interfaces are as per the MOSIP defined specifications for smooth interaction.
