#TBD - Review and Update

Versions in MOSIP and their meaning

The MOSIP platform has versions. The first version of MOSIP is v1 and it has a planned set of features defined in its backlog/roadmap. Versions of MOSIP evolve and start with a base release version - e.g. v1.0.0

The release version tag has the format “vVersion.Evolution.Patch”

v1.1.1 means version 1, evolution 1, patch 1

v1.0.1 means version 1, base evolution, patch 1

v1.1.2 means version 1, evolution 1, patch 2

v1.2.0 means version 1, evolution 2, no patch

v2.0.0 means version 2, base evolution, no patch

v1 and v2 of MOSIP will have their respective roadmaps and feature sets.

A new version release (Major Release) will increment the “Version” number and reset the “Evolution” and “Patch” numbers to zero.

A new evolution release of the version (Minor Release) will retain the “Version” number, increment the “Evolution” number and reset the “Patch” number to zero. 

A new patch release on the evolution (Patch Release) will retain the “Version” and “Evolution” numbers, and increment the “Patch” number.
