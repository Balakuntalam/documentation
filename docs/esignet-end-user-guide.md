# End User Guide

In this user guide, we are taking an example of a Health services portal that acts as a relying party using e-Signet to provide services and benefits to the residents. Also, in turn, the residents can quickly identify themselves using their country's foundation ID system (here MOSIP) thereby avoiding the hassles of repeatedly filling up their account/personal information.

There are multiple ways in which user authentication can be done.

With this release, we support the login flow for the below authentication factors:

1. Login flow for OTP-based authentication
2. Login flow for Biometrics based authentication

Before starting with the login flows, let us understand the following terms:

1. **Essential claims**- These are mandatory user information required by the relying party to be able to provide their services to the residents.
2. **Voluntary claims**- They are additional user information that residents can choose to share to get some add-on features for the service provided by the relying party.

> Note: The screenshots and the steps illustrated below are for demonstration purpose only and are likely to change based on the use case.

## Log in with OTP authentication

Pre-requisite: The resident is issued with a unique virtual ID for a country's foundation ID. In the below demo application, the resident is registered with MOSIP and has a valid UIN or VID.

1\. Resident clicks `Sign In with MOSIP`.
