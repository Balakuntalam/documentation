# Try it out

The latest stable version of the e-Signet solution is deployed in our [Collab](https://collab.mosip.net/) environment. Collab has our latest QA-certified dockers deployed so that:

* Representatives of ID solutions who are seeking a convenient method to enable authentication, as well as those interested in gaining a better understanding of how e-Signet works or those who wish to demonstrate e-Signet.
* Relying parties can efficiently utilize this platform to seamlessly integrate and ascertain its compatibility with the protocols employed by e-Signet.

Here are some ways you can use our sandbox environment: [Collab](https://collab.mosip.net/).
