# ID Authentication

## Overview
Once a UIN is issued, a resident may be authenticated using MOSIP's ID Authentication (IDA) module. As MOSIP is a foundational ID system, different services (govt or private) may use the "single source of truth" to validate identity of a resident rather than implementing multiple different authentication systems.  A typical authentication flow is illustrated below:
