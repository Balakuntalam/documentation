# Features

Below is a sneak peek of the features available in Inji.

1. **Easy installation**

* Build Inji code to generate an APK file. Transfer the APK file to the smartphone on which it is to be installed. Also, to install the app on iOS, build the app and push it onto `TestFlight`.
* Set up the app with biometrics (Face unlock/ fingerprint based on your device settings).
* Also, there is an option to set a passcode to unlock the app and for its subsequent usage.

2. **Downloading the card**

* Keeping your digital credentials (ID) with you at all times just got easier.
* This can be done in two ways:
  * **Downloading VC using the UIN/ VID** – Residents can use the country-provided ID (UIN/VID) to download their cards and avail of various government and private services.
  * **Downloading VC using the Application ID** – Residents can also use their Application ID provided to them during the registration process to be able to download their card.

3. **Viewing details** of the downloaded credential – Residents can have a quick view of the demographic details present on their VCs in a card format.

4. **Quick identification of VCs** by associating them with relevant tags- In case residents have multiple VCs on their device, they can add customized names to the VCs for quick identification.

5. **Maintaining History** - The `History` tab on the app helps the residents in viewing the status of the VCs (downloaded/ shared/ activated, logged-in).

6. **Sharing Credentials** - The downloaded VCs on the device can be easily shared with the Verifier for verification and to provide quick access to their services. The VC can be shared over `Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)` without the need for having an internet connection.

7. **Share with a selfie** - The residents can capture the photo on their mobile device which internally gets matched with the photo available on their card thereby helping them quickly prove their identity.

8. **Activate VC for online login**- Residents can select the VC that can be activated and further used for online login thereby reducing the chances of the VCs being misused.

9. **QR Code login** - Inji can be used to sign-in to any online portal by just scanning the QR code and sharing the data based on resident' consent.
