Below is a sneak-peek of the features available in Inji.

1. **Easy installation**

* Build Inji code to generate an apk file. Transfer the apk file on to a smart phone on which it is to be installed.  Also, to install the app on iOS, build the app and push it on to `TestFlight`.
* Setup the app with biometrics (Face unlock/ fingerprint based on your device settings).
* Also, there is an option set a passcode to unlock the app and for it's subsequent usage.



2. **Downloading the card**

* Keeping your digital credentials (ID) with you at all times just got easier. 
* This can be done by two ways:
    *  `Downloading VC using the UIN/ VID` feature – Residents can use the country provided ID (UIN/VID) to download their cards and avail various government and private services.
    * `Downloading VC using the **Application ID**` feature – Residents can also use their Application ID provided to them during the registration process to be able download their card.




3. **Viewing details** of the downloaded credential – Residents can have a quick view of the demographic details present on their VCs in a card format.
