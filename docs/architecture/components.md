Transfer VC from Wallet to Verifier is facilitated by a react native library called [Tuvali](https://github.com/mosip/tuvali). This library is integrated into inji to allow offline VC transfer between mobile devices over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). 

At present, offline VC transfer is supported between Android to Android and IOS to Android. VC transfer between Android to IOS is not supported yet.
