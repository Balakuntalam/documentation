# Resident Services Developer Setup Documentation

## Overview
Resident services are the self-services which are used by the residents themselves via a portal. Resident Portal is a web based UI application that provides residents of a country the services related to their Unique Identification Number (UIN). You can read the full documentation [here](https://docs.mosip.io/1.2.0/modules/resident-services).

This documentation will guide you to do all types of setup.

## Software setup
There are some tools which we will be use in Resident services:
1. JDK 11.
2. Any IDE (like eclipse, intellij idea).
3. Apache Maven (zip folder).
4. pgAdmin.
5. Postman.
6. Git.
7. Notepad++ (optional).
8. Lombok.jar (file).
9. settings.xml (document).

You can download Lombok.jar and settings.xml from here.

After unzipping Apache Maven, a user needs to move that unzipped folder in ```C:\Program Files``` and "settings.xml" (document file) inside this 'conf' folder ```C:\Program Files\apache-maven-3.8.4\conf```.

After installing Eclipse, a user needs to open the "Lombok.jar" file and wait for some time until it completes the scan for Eclipse IDE then click on 'Install/Update'.
