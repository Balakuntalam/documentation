# Overview

The manual provides an overview of pre-registration and requirements for the registration.

The MOSIP considers that the primary aim of the pre-registration is to reinforce among resident an awareness that enables them to:

*	Enter demographic data & upload supporting documents
*	Book an appointment for one or many users for registration by choosing a suitable registration center and time slot
*	Receive appointment notifications
*	Reschedule and cancel appointments

Once you complete the above process, data will be sent to the respective registration center before appointment, which can be used during the registration process.
