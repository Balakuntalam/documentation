In the current dynamic and globalized world, it is crucial to enhance residents' access to vital services such as healthcare, financial equality, global travel, and assistance. An essential requirement for accessing these services is the authentication of individuals' identity. At present, individuals often manage multiple physical identification documents, each necessary for different rights and services.

Introducing **Inji**, a mobile application specifically created to streamline all types of identification and credentials into one digital wallet. This innovative solution allows for identity verification through a straightforward selfie.

**What does Inji mean?**
