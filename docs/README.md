# Overview 

MOSIP (Modular Open Source Identity Platform) is an open-source platform that provides the foundational infrastructure for implementing digital Identity systems.

As an open platform for digital Identity, MOSIP partners with multiple service providers who offer wide-ranging products and solutions to countries and other user organisations.

MOSIP provides a comprehensive set of specifications defining how various partners in their ecosystem can connect with MOSIP and work inter-operably. It aims to enable governments, organisations, and developers to build and deploy robust, scalable, and interoperable identity solutions.

A set of specifications and procedures with respect to the operation, maintenance, and reliability of materials, products, methods, and services—are the backbone of the technical architecture of the ID system.

## Need for Specifications

The specifications cover a wide range of technical and operational aspects necessary for implementing a robust and secure digital Identity system.

They are designed to be flexible and adaptable to meet the requirements of different contexts and jurisdictions while promoting openness, scalability, and interoperability. 

The MOSIP device specification provides compliance guidelines for devices to work with MOSIP. It also aims to help the device manufacturers, their developers, and their designers in building MOSIP-compliant devices. The compliance is based on device capability, trust and communication protocols. A MOSIP-compliant device would follow the standards established in the documents.

Likewise, the objective of a biometric device specification document would be to establish the technical and compliance standards/ protocols that are necessary for a biometric device to be used in MOSIP solutions. It aims to help the biometric device manufacturers, their developers, and their designers in building MOSIP-compliant devices.

A few of the specifications provided by MOSIP are listed below:

1. Secure biometric interface (SBI) to connect with biometric devices
2. ABIS API specification to connect with ABIS solutions
3. Biometric SDK specification to connect with biometric SDKs  
4. Manual Adjudication API specification to connect with Adjudication specification
5. ID Authentication APIs for relying parties
6. Biometric Specifications for biometric data in MOSIP
7. Hardware Security Module Specifications to connect with HSM solutions
