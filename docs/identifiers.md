# Identifiers

## Overview
The sections here describe various user identifiers used in MOSIP.

## UIN
Unique Identification Number (UIN), as the name suggests, is a unique number assigned to resident. UIN never changes and is non-revocable. UIN is randomized such that one should not be able to derive any Personal Identifyable Information (PII) from the number itself.

The rules that govern generation of a UIN are listed [here](https://github.com/mosip/commons/blob/1.2.0-rc2/kernel/kernel-idgenerator-service/README.md).
