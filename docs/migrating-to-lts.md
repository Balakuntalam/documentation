### Upgrading to ASYMMETRIC AMOEBA

2. **Prioritising** a list of issues that must be fixed before migration 
3. **Understanding and analysing**, in detail, latest changes and customised features
4. **Identifying** sequencing of components and infra to be migrated
5. **Discussing** ways and means to automate specific steps
6. **Migrating** using upgrade scripts- DB, template, config, seed data etc.
    * Phased migration: sandbox, staging, production
7. **Hardening** security
8. **Marking-off** checklist template items


* Time and effort involvement will depend on customisation needs.
* Without customisations, the time needed will be about 2-3 months.
    * Time to deploy: 2 weeks
    * Time to execute upgrade scripts:  2-3 weeks
    * Time taken to test/ verify:
        * Two days for environment sanity using test rig automation
        * 3-4 weeks for full blown testing for all the modules
