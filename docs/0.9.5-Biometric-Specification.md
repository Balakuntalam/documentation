## IRIS Capture
Refer ISO 19794-6:2011 Part 6 Specifications.

Factor | Registration Devices | Authentication Devices
-------|----------------------|-----------------------
Rotation angle | Before compression, the Iris image will have to be preprocessed to calculate rotation angle. Refer section 6.3.1 of ISO 19794-6 for rotation angle calculation for rectilinear images.|
Rotation Uncertainty | Refer ISO 19794-6 |
Minimum Diameter | As per ISO 19794-6:2011 medium and higher quality images are only acceptable,. Hence for this Standard, minimum acceptable Iris diameter will be 150 pixels | Same
Margin | Same as ISO |
Color | The iris images shall be captured and stored in gray scale with pixel depth of 8 bits/pixel |
Illumination | The eye should be illuminated using infrared or any other source that could produce high quality gray scale image |
Image Format | JPEG 2000 lossless | JPEG 2000 lossless
Aspect Ratio | 1:1 |
Image Quality | ISO/IEC 29794-6 | ISO/IEC 29794-6
Operation Temperature\* | -30 C to +50 C | -30 C to +50 C
EMC compliance | FCC Class A or equivalent | FCC Class A or equivalent
Preview | > 3 FPS Jpeg lossless frames with quality score superimposed | Not Applicable
