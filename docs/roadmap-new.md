# ROADMAP

The MOSIP community strives to deliver major releases as per the designated schedules, while offering minor releases every other month! The roadmap outlines the vision, goals, and planned development milestones of all our ongoing and upcoming projects over a specific period of time.  It also provides a high-level overview of the MOSIP platform's future direction, features, enhancements, and major updates.

MOSIP has been deveoped with a focus on addressing challenges related to identity management, privacy, security, and data proctection. It is designed to offer flexibility and modularity, allowing governments to tailor identity systems according to their unique requirements.

MOSIP also encourages collaboration among governments, developers, and other stakeholders to continually improve the platform. <can add community link if required>
