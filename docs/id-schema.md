# ID Schema 

## Overview
**ID Schema** is a standard [JSON schema](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/) that defines the data to be captured from an individual. MOSIP recommends collecting minimal data from the residents. However, information collected from residents may vary country to country. The ID Schema is flexible to accommodate such variations. 

Defining this schema becomes the fundamental step while using MOSIP. Once defined, all applications built on top of MOSIP platform must conform to the same.

The default schema used with MOSIP Sandbox installation is available [here](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-infra/blob/1.2.0-rc2/deployment/v3/mosip/kernel/masterdata/samples/idschema.json).
Along with it, you will also find a guide to customize ID Schema for a countryâ€™s specific attributes.

ID schema is loaded as a part of master data to `identity_schema` table in `mosip_masterdata` DB.

## Configuration guide
This guide helps an adopter customize the default ID Schema for information that are be collected from the residents.  

## Terminology
* **Field**: Unit of date collected from residents (eg. full name, last name, street address, proof of birth etc).   
* **Field attribute**:  Qualification of Field (eg. category, type, etc). 
* **Definition**: Custom data types defined by MOSIP for collecting different types of data:
    * `simpleType`: Multiple langauages.
    * `documentType`: Document metdata.
    * `biometricType`: Biometric file [CBEFF XML]() metadata  

## JSON keys
* `bioAttributes`:

    * `leftEye`, `rightEye`, `leftIndex`, `leftRing`, `leftLittle`, `leftMiddle`, `rightIndex`, `rightRing`, `rightMiddle`, `rightLittle`, `rightThumb`, `leftThumb`, `face`,

* `fieldCategory`
    * `none`: Cannot be used for any purpose. But will be stored in id.json (default sub packet).
    * `pvt`: Private information, can be used only auth.
    * `kyc`: Information that can be disclosed to partners including IDA.
    * `evidence`: Field is treated as proof and may be subjected to removal.
    * `optional`: Field is treated as proof and will be removed after predefined interval (defined as policy).

* `format`
   * `lowercased` 
   * `uppercased`

* `validators`
    * `type`: Validation engine type
    * `validator`: Regex
    * `arguments`: Array to hold parameter or dependent field ids required for validation.

## Dependencies
If any changes are made to the default ID Schema, make sure the following dependencies are updated as well:
1. UI Specification for Pre-registration and Registration Client
1. [Identity Mapping JSON](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-config/blob/develop3-v3/identity-mapping.json)
1. [ID Authentication Mapping JSON](https://github.com/mosip/mosip-config/blob/develop3-v3/id-authentication-mapping.json)
