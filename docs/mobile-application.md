# Resident Mobile Application

## Overview
The mobile application can be used by residents to securely store, share and receive digital credentials. Phase 1 of this application supports only Android OS. 

The mobile application's repo is called [Inji](https://github.com/mosip/inji) and the corresponding backend that works as an intermediate between Inji and MOSIP platform is in [Mimoto repo](https://github.com/mosip/mimoto).

## Format of digital credentials
The digital credentials generated by the mobile application follow the Verifiable Credentials data model. More details can be found [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#:~:text=A%20verifiable%20credential%20is%20a,can%20be%20about%20different%20subjects.)

## Generating and storing of credentials
A Verifiable Credential(VC) can be generated by either using a UIN or a VID. Detailed steps on generating and sharing credentials are given in the user guide [here](https://github.com/mosip/documentation/blob/1.2.0/docs/mobile-id-app-user-guide.md).

## Sharing of credential
In Phase 1 of the application, a VC is shared in peer to peer model. The data exchange between devices is done using Google Nearby Connections API. This API uses a combination of Bluetooth (BT), Bluetooth Low energy (BLE) and Wifi to achieve seamless, low-latency, high-throughput communications without requiring pairing of devices.
