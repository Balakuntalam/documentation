# Overview

Commons or Kernel is on which MOSIP services are built. Commons is a platform to build higher-level services as well as a secure sandbox within which the higher-level service functions. Commons provides a bedrock to build and run the services by providing several significant necessary technical functions so that individual services are concerned with specific business functions. 

Commons is not a distinct module but a bunch of services and libraries that are shared across different modules.
