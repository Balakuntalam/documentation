# Overview

This module enables a resident to:
* Enter demographic data & upload supporting documents
* Book an appointment for one or many users for registration by choosing a suitable registration center and time slot
* Receive appointment notifications
* Reschedule and cancel appointments

Once the residnet completes the above process, their data will be synced to their respective registration centers before their appointment, so that it can be used during the registration process.
