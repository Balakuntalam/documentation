# Usage History

## History of Auth Transactions
* This feature will allow an individual to view history of the authentication request(s) associated to his/her UIN. The individual needs to provide the UIN/VID as input. The system will first validate the UIN/VID, trigger an OTP to individual's registered mobile number and/or email ID, validate the OTP and then authenticate the individual. On successful authentication, the system will send unarchived Authentication History data of the individual associated to the provided UIN and all its associated VIDs. The system will also send a notification message to individualâ€™s mobile number and/or email ID after a successful transaction or appropriate error message if the transaction was not successful.
