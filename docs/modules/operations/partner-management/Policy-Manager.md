## Create,Update,Publish Policy Group

## Create Policy Group
* In order to create a policy we must have a policy group first. The policy admin needs to first create a policy group using the partner management portal.

## Create & Publish Policy
* Once the policy group is created the policy admin can create policies and associate these policies to various policy groups. After these policies are created, they would be in draft state. These policies need to be published by the policy admin. Once published these policies can be used by the partners.

## Update Policy
* A policy can be updated multiple times when it is in draft state. Only the validity date can be updated once the policy is published.

## Activate/Deactivate Policy
* The policy can be activated or de-activated anytime by the policy admin.
