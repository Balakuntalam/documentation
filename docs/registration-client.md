# Overview

The Registration client is a thick Java-based client where the resident's demographic and biometric details are captured along with the supporting documents in online or offline mode. Data is captured in the form of registration packets and is cryptographically secured to ensure that there is no tampering. The captured information is packaged and sent to the server for further processing. <offline and online, multiple language support, transliteration>

Mosip provides a reference implementation of a java based registration client. The code, design, App setup, build documentation is available in **registration client repo**. The App may be modified according to a country's need.
