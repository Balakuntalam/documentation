The partners using the compliance tool kit should be registered in the system. Registered partners can login into the compliance tool kit with the same credentials as they used to register themselves into the partner management portal.

## DASHBOARD
  
Once the user logs into the compliance tool kit, they can view the Project dashboard by default and would have the option to view the Biometric data dashboard as well.
 
* Project: A project is a module that the partner wants to test. For example, if a device partner has developed a new version of his/her SBI for their fingerprint slap device, then, they can create a project in the compliance tool kit to verify this version of SBI.  

* Biometric Data: As part of the compliance tool kit, we provide an option for the partner to upload their test data which can be used to verify the partnerâ€™s software. Currently, in MOSIP, we can upload test data for an SDK or an ABIS.
