# Configuring Packet Manager for priority-based fetch

A priority-based search function in the packet manager was introduced in MOSIP 1.1.5 version. This feature allows us to retrieve data from external sources based on prioritized criteria for validating an applicant's information. These data packets are stored in the object store in a specific format. 

This functionality becomes particularly relevant in cases where a country has implemented a portal for residents to rectify any discrepancies or incomplete information in their registration process. With the priority-based search capability, we can ensure that the most important and relevant source of data is accessed first, enabling a more efficient and accurate data validation process.
